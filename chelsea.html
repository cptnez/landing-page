          <h1>There is only one <em>you.</em></h1>
          <p>This is what I have to show for your birthday...a website! <br>This meger site allows you to reflect
            on time that we've spent together as a couple and perhaps have a few laughs.<br>Go ahead and try out the different links on the site.
            It didn't take me long to find some pics that represent us well.<br>Perhaps the reason why is because every photo we have taken together 
            includes and ball of sincere affection nesteled between us.<br>
          <em>I love you and I hope you enjoy your special day!</em>
